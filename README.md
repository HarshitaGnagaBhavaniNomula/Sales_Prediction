# Welcome to the Sales Prediction Project!


## Sales Prediction 
In this project Store Sales Prediction using machine learning and python, the task is to predict the sales of different stores based on the attributes available in the dataset. Predictive analytics can help us to study and discover the factors that determine the number of sales that a retail store will have in the future by using different machine learning techniques and trying to determine the best algorithm suited to our particular problem statement. We have implemented normal regression techniques and  have found that the  Random Forest Regressor have better results than the regular regression algorithms.

There are few steps involved in the project:
# First stage:

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    
 In this phase, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and prepare it for the predictive modeling phase. Here's a summary of our EDA process:
   Certainly! Below is a sample content that you can include in the README file for your sales prediction project, focusing on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) part:


 1. Summary Statistics:
- Calculated key summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for numerical features like sales, item weights, etc.
- Explored the distribution of categorical variables by counting unique values.

 2. Univariate Analysis:
- Created visualizations, including box plots,to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
- Utilized bar charts and pie charts to visualize the distribution of categorical variables.

 3. Missing Values:
- Identified and handled missing values in the dataset by deciding on appropriate imputation or removal strategies.

 4. Feature Engineering:
- Created new features from existing ones, such as deriving item price or calculating average sales per item type.


This EDA phase provided a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, guiding the subsequent steps in feature engineering and predictive modeling.


 # Second Stage:
 
 ## Model Building 
 
 In this stage, we implemented predictive models to forecast sales based on the insights gained from the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Here's an overview of the steps involved in our model building process:
 Three classification models have been implemented in the  project:
 
       1.Linear Regression
       2.Random Forest Regressor
       3.Random Forest Regressor with k-fold cross-validation

 The performance of the models is assessed using common classification metrics:
 
         1.Root Mean Squared Error
         2. R-squared score
